# Global Shark Fin Ban Tracker

A collaborative, open-source project to track the legislative status of shark fin bans across countries and sub-national jurisdictions (states, provinces, territories).

## Purpose

Shark finning is a major threat to shark populations worldwide, driven by demand for shark fin soup. Many jurisdictions have enacted or proposed bans on shark fin trade and possession. This tracker serves as a central, up-to-date reference for conservationists, policymakers, and advocates to monitor progress, identify gaps, and coordinate advocacy efforts.
